### What is Pub/Sub Messaging 

![Alt text](image.png)

Publish and Subscribe messaging systems enable event-driven architectures which decouple system components to increase reliability, scalability and general performance.


### Examples of Pub/Sub Messaging
- Pub/Sub messaging decouples applications that ingest data into systems from that consume data
- Provides fault tolerance for if a component downstream from messaging queue fails or is brought down for updates (scaling/bug fixes)
- Producers and consumers provide decoupled architecture but must agree on a standard data format
