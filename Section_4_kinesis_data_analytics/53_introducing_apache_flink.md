# Introducing Apache Flink

- Framework and distributed processing engine for stateful computations on batch and stream oriented workloads
- used to build scalable, high performance/high throughput, low-latency data-processing pipelines
- hierarchy of Programming APIs to fit various personas and use cases
  - SQL and Table APIs: relational, suitable for analytics, batch processing and simple streaming ETL pipeline
    - SQL, Python, Scala and JAVA
  - DataStream API is a Fluent API that is considerably more flexible than the SQL and Table APIs
    - Implemented as regular Java, Scala, or Python programs that perform stateful transformations on batch or stream oriented data
